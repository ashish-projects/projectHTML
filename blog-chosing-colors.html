<li>Choosing a dominant color as your brand color</li>
The dominant color is your brand color – like the fire engine red for Coca-Cola.
Only use your dominant color in a limited number of places where you want your website visitors to pay attention to, or if you want your visitors to take certain actions (such as call a phone number, fill in a contact form, sign up to a newsletter, etc).



<li>Choosing 1 to 2 accent colors to create a color scheme for your website</li>
Once you have your dominant color, it’s really easy to find your accent colors by using color matching tools like Adobe Color CC tool.


<li>Choose your website background color</li>
Have you ever noticed that most information websites or ecommerce websites usually use white or a neutral background color?
The focus is on the content or products, rather than the design of the website.  The background color is only a backdrop to help make the content more visible and readable.

For websites used in fashion, design, restaurant, beauty and creative industries, the world is your oyster.

There are really no rules as to what background image or colors you should use. You can use a black menu bar to create more drama; Or you can use all the colors of the rainbow to create an inspirational background image.

Your perfect background color is one that allows your content to be the focal point while working harmoniously with your dominant & accent colors, and makes your audience feel good while browsing your website.

(1) Matching your brand with the right dominant color; (2) matching the dominant color with accent colors using the Adobe tool; and finally (3) matching the background color with your dominant & accent colors.
